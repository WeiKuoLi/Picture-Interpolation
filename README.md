# Picture-Interpolation
This is a project for pixel interpolation for hollowed out pictures.
I used convolutional neural network for test purpose.

For loss function(for trainging purpose) I use MSE(Mean Squared Error) metric.

For training data set, I used the rescaled 128 x 128 CIFAR-100 dataset for test purpose.
